Female marines in halo CE

At long last, the hotly demanded female marines in halo CE are here!

I decided to undertake the rather daunting task of trying to make female human characters possible in CE, by fixing the rig of the pilot. I've tried to do this several times and only made small amounts of progress each time. The pilot skeleton in the base game sort of matches the marine animation rig, but there are a lot of issues. Armed with a the Rokoko animation retargeting blender plugin plus a lot of messing with the nodes, I have fixed all the issues and used the plugin to retarget all of the male marine animations onto the fixed female skeleton. Additionally, there are some extra animations in there such as for weapons like rocket lanucher and flamethrower, as well as fixes for a lot of issues with the base marine animations, such as holding weapons in pelican seats. This is the result. Please let me know if you notice any issues with this. There is still some room for improvement, but I really want to release them, as it's already taken me too long to do so.
