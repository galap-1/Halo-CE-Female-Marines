# Halo-CE-Female-Marines
Female marines in halo CE

At long last, the hotly demanded female marines in halo CE are here!

I decided to undertake the rather daunting task of trying to make female human characters possible in CE, by fixing the rig of the pilot. I've tried to do this several times and only made small amounts of progress each time. The pilot skeleton in the base game sort of matches the marine animation rig, but there are a lot of issues. Armed with a the Rokoko animation retargeting blender plugin plus a lot of messing with the nodes, I have fixed all the issues and used the plugin to retarget all of the male marine animations onto the fixed female skeleton. Additionally, there are some extra animations in there such as for weapons like rocket lanucher and flamethrower, as well as fixes for a lot of issues with the base marine animations, such as holding weapons in pelican seats. This is the result. Please let me know if you notice any issues with this. There is still some room for improvement, but I really want to release them, as it's already taken me too long to do so.

Update: 12-16-23:
I have added many new animations, such as 2-handed pistol animations, better animatons for plasma pistol, banshee, scorpion driver, cryo tube, and also some animations that the AI does't use, such as melee, moving unarmed crouch (which is in the tag but not set up) and a faster grenade throw that could potentially be used for a player-controlled biped. female_marine_256.model animations is there for legacy custom edition support, and doesn't have any new animations (CE has a maximum of 256 anims). Chimera enables expansion of this limit however. Added player-animations file, which removes hard ping references and replaces grenade throwing with faster animation.
